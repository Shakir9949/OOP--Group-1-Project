Problem Statement
Many people struggle to keep track of their grocery items at home, often buying duplicates or forgetting what they already have. This leads to food waste, overspending, and disorganized kitchens. A simple console-based grocery inventory manager can help users monitor whatâ€™s in their pantry, update quantities, set expiration alerts, and generate shopping lists based on current stock.
Project Description
We will create a menu-driven console application called "Smart Grocery Inventory Manager." This system allows users to:
1. Add grocery items with name, quantity, category, and expiration date
2. View current inventory grouped by category
3. Edit or remove items
4. Mark used items and updated the quantity
5. Generate a shopping list based on low-stock items
6. View items expiring soon

The user will interact through a simple text-based menu like:
1. Add New Grocery Item 
2. View Inventory 
3. Update Quantity or Remove Item 
4. Check Expiring Items 
5. Generate Shopping List 
6. Clear the items

All items will be stored in memory (or optionally saved to a file), and users will be prompted with intuitive inputs.

First Milestone:

By the first milestone, we aim to complete:
1. Fully functional menu system
2. Ability to add items (name, quantity, category)
3. View inventory grouped by category
4. Edit and delete basic item entries
5. Use of lists/dictionaries (or custom classes)
6. This will establish the base structure, allowing us to add expiration and shopping features later.
